An quite simple implementation of quicksort and binary search in vectors. The program is written in C programming language.

To run the program compiled with GCC and then run the executable as the following example:

./vectors 12 9 -l

The argument of this program are sth like this:
*First argument: integer
 is the size of the vector
*Second argument: integer (again...)
 is the element you're looking for inside the vector (binary search)
*Third argument: -l
 tells the program to run in library mode, using our vector.h library

Feel free to include any other arguments, they'll be ignored.
